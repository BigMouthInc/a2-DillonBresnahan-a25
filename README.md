Welcome to the Age/Pet Database! I used flexboxs to position my input and buttons. Follow the instructions on the tex boxes to properly use the application!

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I created a singular paged application where the table updates automatically after any data is added, removed, or updated. This includes the dervived field edited on the server side
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I added the ability to edit any row of the table by typing into an input box. If you edit Age or #OfPets, the dervived field automatically updates.


## Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I did a think-aloud walkthrough with both Cameron Norris and Akaash Walker. I tasked Cameron to add himself to the database, then edit some of his data. I tasked Akaash to remove whichever row he would like, then edit one of the remaining rows. They both found it simple, but stated that the text input form for updating rows having commas did not accuratley represent what they had to put in. This is due to commas causing the input to not be read properly. To fix this, I removed commas from the input field.

## AI Usage
In this assignment, I used the LLM Chat-GPT for minor bug fixes, like incorrect JavaScript syntax and issues with typos in my functions and variables when called again.
